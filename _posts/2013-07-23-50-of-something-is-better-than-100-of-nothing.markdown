My father always told me, “50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.”

When I first bought whoistimsteele.com, I was so determined to come up with the perfect design that I spent all my time researching inspiration, sketching concepts and creating mock-ups. Then work would pick up or life would take over and my site would sit dormant. Repeat this process for four years.

This constant delaying could be a great argument for the importance of self-imposed deadlines. I could take a psychological approach – by delaying the design, I won’t have to begin coding (see “[The Carpenter’s Door Never Gets Fixed](http://www.whoistimsteele.com/the-carpenters-door-never-gets-fixed/ "The Carpenter’s Door Never Gets Fixed…")”).  But this time when I approached whoistimsteele.com, I tossed out my delusions of “the greatest website ever”, chose a WordPress theme, and now I have something.

Recently I have begun development on a mobile app that corresponds with a website. This is a small, start-up business project so we are facing some small, start-up business problems – lack of funding, lack of resources, lack of time. This leads to some compromises. I have begun developing for iOS and Android using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/ "PhoneGap").

For those of you who are unfamiliar with PhoneGap, here it is in a nutshell:  you develop a website using Web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and it wraps your ‘website’ in an application. I know this isn’t as ideal as writing the apps in native code. Some of you may cry out, “Tim, haven’t you read Drew Crawford’s ‘[Why mobile web apps are slow](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/ "Why mobile apps are slow")’?” The answer is yes, yes I have read Drew’s article. Yes I know this isn’t ideal.

But sometimes I have to be realistic: I have limited resources, limited time and my strength is front-end technology. That is where PhoneGap shines. It will allow me to build something, and 50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.
